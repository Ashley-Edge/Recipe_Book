			<p>People all over the world have been drinking tea for thousands of centuries, and for good
				reason. Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may boost your immune system,
				fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease. While some brews
				provide more health advantages than others, thereâ€™s plenty of evidence that regularly
				drinking tea can have a lasting impact on your wellness. At the very least, tea is a
				flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day.</p>

				<li>
					Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to
					keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
				</li>
				<li>
					Pop your chosen tea bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)
				</li>
				<li>
					Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its
					thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about life
					after covid (I dream about a career in DevOps or web development).
				</li>
				<li>
					Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of
					the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
				</li>
				<li>
					Enjoy!
