I got this idea from doing a 5-day coding challenge with [Code Institute,](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/e) I loved refreshing my very basic HTML and CSS with their challenge. I would highly recommend anybody to give it a go! I thought this would be a fun way to experiment, show off and practice my improving skills with different recipes..
