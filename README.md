# Recipe Book :orange_book:

I got this idea from doing a 5-day coding challenge with [Code Institute,](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/) I loved refreshing my very basic HTML and CSS with their challenge. I recommend that anybody give it a go! This would be a fun way to experiment, show off, and practice my improving skills with different recipes.

### Cup of Tea :tea:

This is the original Recipe Cup of Tea HTML and CSS web page I created during the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/) 5-day challenge.  Therefore, all credit goes to Code Institute for this recipe page layout. :smile:

1. First day of this project. First, we were taught to code placeholders for the header, two sections, and footer. This is a great way to lay out a webpage without worrying about context right way. Then I was instructed to input the text components of the recipe.
2. Second day. Adding an image, and styling through CSS, and making this page flexible.
