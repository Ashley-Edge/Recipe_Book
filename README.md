# Recipe Book :orange_book:

I got this idea from doing a 5-day coding challenge with [Code Institute,](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/) I loved refreshing my very basic HTML and CSS with their challenge. I would highly recommend anybody to give it a go! I thought this would be a fun way to experyiment, show off and practice my improving skills with different recipes.

### Cup of Tea :tea:

This is the original Recipe Cup of Tea HTML and CSS web page I created during the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/) 5-day challenge.  Therefore, all credit goes to Code Institute for this recipe pages layout. :smile:

1. First day of this project. First we where taught to code placeholders for the header, two sections and footer. This is a great way to layout a webpage without worrying about context right ways. Then I was instructed to input the text componants of the recipie.
